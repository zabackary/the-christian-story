# The Christian Story

## Hosted copy

Feel free to build the game for yourself, but the online hosted copy is
available on GitHub Pages at https://zabackary.github.io/the-christian-story/.

## Why?

This project sums up the four big steps of the Christian story which all
Christians and ultimately the entire world is a part of: the creation of Earth
and our creation in God's image; the fall and entrance of sin into the world;
our redemption through Jesus Christ; and the coming restoration and new heaven
and earth. It aims to convey these concepts in an easy-to-understand and
approachable format for Christians and non-Christians alike.

The other reason for this project is for my
[Intro to Christianity](https://caj.ac.jp/info/index.php/Course_Descriptions#Bible_9:_Introduction_to_Christianity)
class at [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp/), a Christian
international school in Higashikurume, Tokyo, Japan. Maybe I'll get a better
grade if you star this repo ðŸ˜‚. _(don't worry, the game is probably not good
enough to warrent any praise.)_

## How can you help?

If you're inclined to work with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas (2d context) and you
think you've found a bug, feel free to send a pull request. Note that your
changes' licensing is on shaky legal ground since I'm not a lawyer, but they
should be licensed under the MIT license included with your copy of the
codebase.

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To build and type-check,
clone the repo with
`git clone https://github.com/zabackary/the-christian-story.git` then run
install the deps and run `pnpm build`. To start the development server, run
`pnpm dev`. I make use of [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for the package manager, so
install that if you don't have that already.
